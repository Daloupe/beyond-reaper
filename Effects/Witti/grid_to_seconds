/*
Say you want to insert an item of a specific length
between some adjacent items on (another) track.

You can use Xenakios 'Reposition items...' action
to insert gaps of a specific length between these items.

Unfortunately the action is based on seconds.
(and this plugin is only working with items which are perfectly fitting to the grid.)

So set your grid division and count the beats(bars) of the item you want to insert.
Adjust these values in the plugin.
The plugin will readout the seconds.
Put the result into the Xenakios action window.
This will give you the exact gap.

Then copy/paste the item between the other items.

Sounds more complicated than it is, really... :)
