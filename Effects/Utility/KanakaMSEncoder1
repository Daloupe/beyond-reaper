// ok so if you do // then it's a comment. the desc: line is the description

// you can have one or more slider lines, these are controls the user can fudge with

// the first number is the default value, the numbers in the <> are min val,
// max val, and step.

@init
// this is stuff that happens once (or if the samplerate changes, etc)

@slider
// this happens when a slider changes

// so we'll set our multiplier to be used later
// so realistically this happens once or when the user changes shit.
// we store our volume multiplier in 'vol', for use per-sample. 
// in theory the sample code below could have this directly...

@block
// this happens per-block, not really that important for this app

@sample
// this happens per-sample. spl0 is the left channel, spl1 is the right,
// and if your track has more than 2 channels, spl2, spl3, etc..
