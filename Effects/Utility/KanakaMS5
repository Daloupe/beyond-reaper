desc:Basic M/S Decoder
// ok so if you do // then it's a comment. the desc: line is the description

// you can have one or more slider lines, these are controls the user can fudge with

slider1:0<-120,24,1>Center Level (dB)
slider2:0<0,1,1>output swap
slider3:0<-1,1,0.01>Center position

// the first number is the default value, the numbers in the <> are min val,
// max val, and step.

@init
// this is stuff that happens once (or if the samplerate changes, etc)

@slider
// this happens when a slider changes

// so we'll set our multiplier to be used later
// so realistically this happens once or when the user changes shit.
// we store our volume multiplier in 'vol', for use per-sample. 
// in theory the sample code below could have this directly...
vol = 2^(slider1/6); // convert from dB to a multiplier

@block
// this happens per-block, not really that important for this app

@sample
// this happens per-sample. spl0 is the left channel, spl1 is the right,
// and if your track has more than 2 channels, spl2, spl3, etc..



// decoder section below

tmp=spl0*vol;
spl0 = tmp + spl1;
spl1 = tmp - spl1;

slider3 > 0  ? spl0 *= 1.0-slider3;
